For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature\'s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don\'t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nDeath\nEach target must make a Constitution Saving Throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nDiscord\nEach target must make a Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks.\n\nFear\nEach target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\nHopelessness\nEach target must make a Charisma Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can\'t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n\nInsantity\nEach target must make an Intelligence Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\'t take actions, can\'t understand what other creatures say, can\'t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n\nPain\nEach target must make a Constitution Saving Throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\nSleep\nEach target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\nStunning\nEach target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.',

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\'t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

"Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\'s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\'s secret tomb.\n\n"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\'t very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else\'s description, perhaps from a map.\n\n"False destination" is a place that doesn\'t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy\'s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\nOn Target\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\nOff Target\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15%, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area\nYou and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\'s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\'s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap\nThe spell\'s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).',

        'description': 'You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.\n\nYou make all decisions about the temple\'s appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.\n\nThe temple\'s interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.\n\nThe temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma Saving Throw. On a failed save, it can\'t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an Attack Roll, an Ability Check, or a Saving Throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.\n\nIn addition, the sensors created by divination spells can\'t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can\'t be targeted by divination spells.\n\nFinally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom Modifier (minimum 1 hit point).\n\nThe temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple\'s interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple\'s exterior. It can\'t be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.\n\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.',
